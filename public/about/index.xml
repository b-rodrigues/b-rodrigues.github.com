      <description>My name is Bruno Rodrigues and hold a PhD in Economics from the University of Strasbourg.
I&amp;rsquo;m currently employed as a statistician for the Ministry of Higher Education and Research in Luxembourg. Before that I was senior data scientist and then manager in the data science team at PwC Luxembourg, and before that I was a research assistant at STATEC Research.
My hobbies are boxing, lifting weights, cycling, cooking and reading or listening to audiobooks, which is more compatible with the life of a young father.</description>
