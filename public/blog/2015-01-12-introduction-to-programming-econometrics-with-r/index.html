<p>This semester, I&rsquo;ll be teaching an introduction to applied econometrics with R, so I&rsquo;ve decided to write a very small book called &ldquo;Introduction to programming Econometrics with R&rdquo;. This is primarily intended for bachelor students and the focus is not much on econometric theory, but more on how to implement econometric theory into computer code, using the R programming language. It&rsquo;s very basic and doesn&rsquo;t cover any advanced topics in econometrics and is intended for people with 0 previous programming knowledge. It is still very rough around the edges, and it&rsquo;s missing the last chapter about reproducible research, and the references, but I think it&rsquo;s time to put it out there; someone else than my students may find it useful. The book&rsquo;s probably full of typos and mistakes, so don&rsquo;t hesitate to drop me an e-mail if you find something fishy:
contact@brodrigues.co</p>

<p>Also there might be some sections at the beginning that only concern my students. Just ignore that.</p>

<p>Get it here: <a href="https://cloud.openmailbox.org/index.php/s/ghZwBxMb24tWGSL">download</a></p>

<h3 id="update-2017-01-22">Update (2017-01-22)</h3>

<p>You might find the book useful as it is now, but I never had a chance to finish it. I might get back to
it once I&rsquo;ll have more time, and port it to bookdown.</p>
