I have been recently confronted to the issue of finding similarities among time-series and though
about using k-means to cluster them. To illustrate the method, I'll be using data from the 
Penn World Tables, readily available in R (inside the `{pwt9}` package):

```{r, include = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)
library(pwt9)
library(brotools)
```
```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)
library(pwt9)
library(brotools)
```

First, of all, let's only select the needed columns:

```{r}
pwt <- pwt9.0 %>%
select(country, year, avh)
```

`avh` contains the average worked hours for a given country and year. The data looks like this:

```{r}
head(pwt)
```

For each country, there's yearly data on the `avh` variable. The goal here is to cluster the different
countries by looking at how similar they are on the `avh` variable. Let's do some further cleaning.
The k-means implementation in R expects a wide data frame (currently my data frame is in the long 
format) and no missing values. These could potentially be imputed, but I can't be bothered:

```{r}
pwt_wide <- pwt %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = year, values_from = avh)  %>%
  filter(!is.na(`1950`)) %>%
  mutate_at(vars(-country), as.numeric)
```

To convert my data frame from long to wide, I use the fresh `pivot_wider()` function, instead of the 
less intuitive `spread()` function.

We're ready to use the k-means algorithm. To know how many clusters I should aim for, I'll be using
the elbow method (if you're not familiar with this method, click on the image at the very top of
this post):

```{r}
wss <- map_dbl(1:5, ~{kmeans(select(pwt_wide, -country), ., nstart=50,iter.max = 15 )$tot.withinss})

n_clust <- 1:5

elbow_df <- as.data.frame(cbind("n_clust" = n_clust, "wss" = wss))


ggplot(elbow_df) +
geom_line(aes(y = wss, x = n_clust), colour = "#82518c") +
theme_blog()
```

Looks like 3 clusters is a good choice. Let's now run the kmeans algorithm:

```{r}
clusters <- kmeans(select(pwt_wide, -country), centers = 3)
```

`clusters` is a list with several interesting items. The item `centers` contains the "average" 
time series:

```{r}
(centers <- rownames_to_column(as.data.frame(clusters$centers), "cluster"))
```

`clusters` also contains the `cluster` item, which tells me to which cluster the different countries
belong to. I can easily add this to the original data frame:

```{r}
pwt_wide <- pwt_wide %>% 
  mutate(cluster = clusters$cluster)
```

Now, let's prepare the data for visualisation. I have to go back to a long data frame for this:

```{r}
pwt_long <- pwt_wide %>%
  pivot_longer(cols=c(-country, -cluster), names_to = "year", values_to = "avh") %>%
  mutate(year = ymd(paste0(year, "-01-01")))

centers_long <- centers %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = -cluster, names_to = "year", values_to = "avh") %>%  
  mutate(year = ymd(paste0(year, "-01-01")))
```

And I can now plot the different time series, by cluster and highlight the "average" time series
for each cluster as well (yellow line):

```{r} 
ggplot() +
  geom_line(data = pwt_long, aes(y = avh, x = year, group = country), colour = "#82518c") +
  facet_wrap(~cluster, nrow = 1) + 
  geom_line(data = centers_long, aes(y = avh, x = year, group = cluster), col = "#b58900", size = 2) +
  theme_blog() +
  labs(title = "Average hours worked in several countries", 
       caption = "The different time series have been clustered using k-means.
                 Cluster 1: Belgium, Switzerland, Germany, Denmark, France, Luxembourg, Netherlands,
                 Norway, Sweden.\nCluster 2: Australia, Colombia, Ireland, Iceland, Japan, Mexico,
                 Portugal, Turkey.\nCluster 3: Argentina, Austria, Brazil, Canada, Cyprus, Spain, Finland,
                 UK, Italy, New Zealand, Peru, USA, Venezuela") +
  theme(plot.caption = element_text(colour = "white"))
```
