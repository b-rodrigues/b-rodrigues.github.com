<p>I was recently asked how to go about matching several datasets where different samples of
individuals were interviewed. This sounds like a big problem; say that you have dataset A and B,
and that A contain one sample of individuals, and B another sample of individuals, then how could
you possibly match the datasets? Matching datasets requires a common identifier, for instance,
suppose that A contains socio-demographic information on a sample of individuals I, while B,
contains information on wages and hours worked on the same sample of individuals I, then yes,
it will be possible to match/merge/join both datasets.</p>
<p>But that was not what I was asked about; I was asked about a situation where the same population
gets sampled twice, and each sample answers to a different survey. For example the first survey
is about labour market information and survey B is about family structure. Would it be possible to
combine the information from both datasets?</p>
<p>To me, this sounded a bit like missing data imputation problem, but where all the information
about the variables of interest was missing! I started digging a bit, and found that not only there
was already quite some literature on it, there is even a package for this, called <code>{StatMatch}</code> with
a very detailed <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/StatMatch/vignettes/Statistical_Matching_with_StatMatch.pdf">vignette</a>.
The vignette is so detailed, that I will not write any code, I just wanted to share this package!</p>
