## Introduction

I was able to blog during the year 2020 without mentioning the ongoing pandemic once. It's not that I made
any conscious effort not to talk about it, but I did not really want to do something that had already
been done a 1000 times. This changed this year, when I wanted to look at the spread of 
COVID-19, not only in the Grand-Duchy of Luxembourg, the country I live in, but also among our 
neighbours. You see, the Grand-Duchy of Luxembourg is like an island, but instead of being surrounded
by water, it's surrounded by Belgians, Germans and Frenchmen. Many of them commute every day to Luxembourg
to work, and even though they technically don't live inside the country, many aspects of their 
lives happen inside Luxembourguish borders. Their children might even come to school here, and sometimes
they live so close by the border, that they can catch Luxembourguish public transportation in their
towns. 200k commuters from Belgium, Germany and France work here every day. That's half our 
workforce! So that's why I thought that it would make sense to look at the spread of the disease
at the level of the so-called *Greater Region*. This *Greater Region* is made up of the Grand-Duchy
of Luxembourg, the Provinces of Liège and Luxembourg in Belgium (hence why I keep writing the
*Grand-Duchy of* Luxembourg to refer to the country, and the *Province of Luxembourg* to refer
to the Belgian province of the same name), and two German *Länders*, the Saarland and 
the Rhineland-Palatinate. Confused? Welcome to Europe, where supranational institutions
literally have to have a page entitled [Do not get confused](https://www.coe.int/en/web/about-us/do-not-get-confused)
so that citizens don't get lost (we still do).

So the Greater Region is not a state, but facilitates collaboration between the regions comprising
it. To me, technically a citizen of the Greater Region, it feels like there was a want to **peacefully** correct
for the randomness of history, where German-speaking regions ended up in both France and Belgium, 
and where Belgium and Luxembourg, well, somehow became independent countries.

Anyways, what I wanted to do was to first of all get the COVID-19 daily cases data for each of these
regions. I did that, and even created a package called `{covidGrandeRegion}` hosted
[here](https://github.com/b-rodrigues/covidGrandeRegion) that makes it very easy to download the 
latest data for the Greater Region. I will write another blog post about it, I have something
in mind that I wanted to try for some time, and this was the first step.
Then I thought that adding a function that would create a map could also be nice. And this is
where the technical aspect of this blog post starts.

## The problems to map the Greater Region

So how do you draw a map for an arbitrary landmass like the Greater Region? I wanted to draw the
maps using `{echarts4r}`, and there's a very easy [guide you can read](https://echarts4r.john-coene.com/articles/make-geo-json.html).
If you want to draw a map for one, or several, countries, this guide is all you need. But I wanted 
a map with only parts of France, Belgium and Germany. The only complete country was Luxembourg.
So the first problem was how to get only parts of a country. The second problem, is that I had 
daily covid cases for the lowest administrative levels for France (which are *Départements*), 
Belgium (the *Provinces*) and Germany (*Land-* and *Stadtkreise*). But for the Grand-Duchy of Luxembourg,
there's only data at the level of the country. So this would be another problem. How to draw a map
with unequal levels of precision?
One final problem: the names of the administrative divisions in my covid datasets are not the same
than the ones that get downloaded if you follow the guide I linked before. So I had to rename 
them as well.

## The solutions

Let's first start by following the guide, so loading the packages, and getting the maps I need:

```{r, include = FALSE}
library(echarts4r)
library(sp)
library(raster)
library(geojsonio)
```

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(echarts4r)
library(sp)
library(raster)
library(geojsonio)
```

```{r}
france_dep <- getData("GADM", country = "FRANCE", level = 2)

ger_kreise <- getData("GADM", country = "GERMANY", level = 2)

be_province <- getData("GADM", country = "BELGIUM", level = 2)
```

The above lines of code load the required packages, and download the maps for France, Belgium
and Germany with the required administrative level I need. I'll leave Luxembourg for last.

Let's take a look at what type of object we're dealing with:

```{r}
class(france_dep)
```

So it seems to be something like a data frame, but probably more complex. Looking for some help
online, I saw that you can coerce it to a data frame:

```{r}
as.data.frame(be_province)
```

We're not going to convert them to data frames however; but this is an interesting clue; these `SpatialPolygonsDataFrame`
objects share common methods with data frames. What this means is that we can use the usual, 
base R way of manipulating these objects.

So to get only the French *départements* I need, I can slice them like so:

```{r}
lorraine <- france_dep[`%in%`(france_dep$NAME_2, c("Meurthe-et-Moselle", "Meuse", "Moselle", "Vosges")),]
```

Same for the German *kreise*, here I select the *Länder* which are a higher administrative division
than the Kreise, which makes it faster (so I don't need to type all the 40+ Kreise):

```{r}
ger_kreise <- ger_kreise[`%in%`(ger_kreise$NAME_1, c("Rheinland-Pfalz", "Saarland")),]
```

For Germany, many Kreise had a name which was different than on my covid data, so I had to 
rename them. So here again, the base R way of doing things works:

```{r}
ger_kreise$NAME_2[ger_kreise$NAME_2 == "Eifelkreis Bitburg-Prüm"]  <- "Bitburg-Prüm"
ger_kreise$NAME_2[ger_kreise$NAME_2 == "St. Wendel"]  <- "Sankt Wendel"
ger_kreise$NAME_2[ger_kreise$NAME_2 == "Altenkirchen (Westerwald)"]  <- "Altenkirchen"
ger_kreise$NAME_2[ger_kreise$NAME_2 == "Neustadt an der Weinstraße"]  <- "Neustadt a.d.Weinstraße"
ger_kreise$NAME_2[ger_kreise$NAME_2 == "Landau in der Pfalz"]  <- "Landau i.d.Pfalz"
ger_kreise$NAME_2[ger_kreise$NAME_2 == "Ludwigshafen am Rhein"]  <- "Ludwigshafen"
ger_kreise$NAME_2[ger_kreise$NAME_2 == "Frankenthal (Pfalz)"]  <- "Frankenthal"
```

Finally, I do the same for Belgium, and rename their province of Luxembourg, which was simply called
"Luxembourg", to "Province de Luxembourg":

```{r}
be_wallonia <- be_province[be_province$NAME_1 == "Wallonie", ]
be_wallonia$NAME_2[be_wallonia$NAME_2 == "Luxembourg"]  <- "Province de Luxembourg"
```

I rename the province because the Grand-Duchy of Luxembourg is also only called "Luxembourg" in the
data, and this would cause issues when mapping.

Now, comes Luxembourg. As I've written above, I only have data at the level of the country, so 
I download the country map:

```{r}
lu_map_0 <- getData("GADM", country = "LUXEMBOURG", level = 0)
```

Let's also see how it looks like as a data frame:

```{r}
as.data.frame(lu_map_0)
```

Unlike the previous `SpatialPolygonsDataFrame`s, there are much less columns and this will cause
an issue. Indeed, in order to have a single `SpatialPolygonsDataFrame` object to draw my map, 
I will need to combine them. This will be very easy, by simple using the `rbind()` function.
Again, simply using base R functions. However, this only works if the data frames have the same
columns. Another issue, is that I will be using the names of the regions which are in the `SpatialPolygonsDataFrame`s'
column called `NAME_2`, but for Luxembourg, the name of the region (in this case the whole country)
is in the column called `NAME_0`. So I need to add this columns to the `SpatialPolygonsDataFrame`
object for Luxembourg:

```{r}
lu_map_0$GID_1 <- NA
lu_map_0$NAME_1 <- NA
lu_map_0$NL_NAME_1 <- NA
lu_map_0$GID_2 <- NA
lu_map_0$NAME_2 <- "Luxembourg"
lu_map_0$VARNAME_2 <- NA
lu_map_0$NL_NAME_2 <- NA
lu_map_0$TYPE_2 <- NA
lu_map_0$ENGTYPE_2 <- NA
lu_map_0$CC_2 <- NA
lu_map_0$HASC_2 <- NA
```

Aaaand... that's it! Wasn't that hard, but a bit convoluted nonetheless. Now I can bind all
the `SpatialPolygonsDataFrame` objects in one and use that for mapping:

```{r}
grande_region <- do.call(rbind, list(lorraine, ger_kreise, be_wallonia, lu_map_0))

as.data.frame(grande_region)
```

And now I can continue following the tutorial from the `{echarts4r}` website, by converting this
`SpatialPolygonsDataFrame` object for the Greater Region into a geojson file which can now be 
used to draw maps! You can take a look at the final result [here](https://happy-newton-bf63ad.netlify.app/).

I don't post the code to draw the map here, because it would require some more tinkering by 
joining the COVID data. But you can find my raw script [here](https://github.com/b-rodrigues/covidGrandeRegion/blob/master/data-raw/maps.R)
(lines 51 to 61) or you could also take a look at the `draw_map()` function from the package
I made, which you can find [here](https://github.com/b-rodrigues/covidGrandeRegion/blob/master/R/draw_map.R).

I really like the end result, `{echarts4r}` is really a fantastic package!
Stay tuned part 2 of the project, which will deal with machine learning.
